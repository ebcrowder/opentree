## Acknowledgments

* Hat tip to Stephen Grider's various courses on React and Redux (https://rallycoding.com/). The architecture of this application was based on a project in the "Node with React: Fullstack Web Development" course. In particular, the code for the OAuth 2.0 authentication flow from that course was implemented here and modified where appropriate.
* Inspired by the closing of a beloved Washington, DC yoga studio. I hope this application allows small businesses operating in the health & wellness industry to save on operating expenses and allow for them to make meaningful connections to their clients.
